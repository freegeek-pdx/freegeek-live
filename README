This should generate a live/install image for Free Geek's Xubuntu 12.04 
distribution. It includes too much to fit on a CD image, but should easily fit
on a DVD.

Ironically, it is tested to build on a Debian Wheezy system.

Install live-build (3.0~b6-1 or newer, currently only in debian sid):

  sudo apt-get install live-build

Install git:

  sudo apt-get install git

  git clone git://git.freegeek.org/git/freegeek-live

Run the build script:

  cd freegeek-live

  ./build

This should  produce a binary.iso image which can be burned to DVD, as well as
some files useable for network booting binary/casper/vmlinuz, 
binary/casper/initrd.lz, binary/casper/filesystem.squashfs.
